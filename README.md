# 🎯 Project Objectives

* Simplify sports facility booking.
* Automate booking and billing calculations.
* Maintain game information dynamically.
* Secure administrator operations.
* Store all records permanently using text files.
* Provide a centralized schedule management system.

# ✨ Key Features

## 🔐 Secure Admin Authentication

* Username & Password based login
* Maximum **3 login attempts**
* Unauthorized access prevention
* Separate Admin and Customer interfaces

---

## 🎮 Dynamic Game Management

Admin can:

* Add new sports
* Delete existing sports
* View all available games
* Store game information dynamically in **games.txt**

Each game stores:

* Game Name
* Price Per Hour
* Minimum Duration

---

## 🏸 Smart Booking Engine

Customers/Admin can:

* Select available games
* Enter booking time
* Automatic duration calculation
* Automatic billing calculation
* Booking confirmation

---

## ⏰ 24-Hour Time Validation

The system validates:

* Invalid time ranges
* Start time
* End time
* Booking duration

Example:

```
09:00 - 12:00
Duration = 3 Hours
```

---

## 💰 Automated Billing System

The system automatically calculates:

```
Total Bill
=
Game Price × Total Hours
```

Example:

```
Badminton
Price = $15/hr

Hours = 3

Total = $45
```

---

## 🆔 Unique Booking ID Generator

Each booking automatically generates a unique **5-digit Booking ID** using:

```c
time(NULL)
```

Example:

```
Booking ID : #54827
```

---

## ✅ Game Validation

Before booking:

* Checks whether the game exists
* Rejects invalid game names
* Prevents fake bookings

---

## 📅 Schedule Tracking

Displays:

* Booking ID
* Customer Name
* Game Name
* Time Slot
* Total Bill

Allows administrators to monitor every booked slot.

---

## 👥 Member Tracking

Automatically tracks every successful booking.

Displays:

* Member Name
* Booked Game
* Time Slot
* Booking ID

Also shows:

* Total Confirmed Members

---

## 📢 Dynamic Notice Board

Supports:

* Viewing Sports Complex Rules
* Admin Announcement Updates
* Real-time Notice Editing

Stored inside:

```
notice.txt
```

---

## ❌ Booking Cancellation

Booking can be cancelled using:

* Booking ID

Implements:

* Temporary File Creation
* Record Replacement
* File Rename Technique
